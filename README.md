# Pneumonia AI Dev

Welcome to the Pneumonia AI Dev project! This project aims to develop an artificial intelligence system capable of detecting pneumonia from medical images with high accuracy. Our goal is to assist healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia more efficiently and effectively, ultimately improving patient outcomes.

## Project Overview

Pneumonia is a significant health problem worldwide and can be challenging to diagnose, especially in areas with limited medical resources. Our AI system uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze chest X-ray images for signs of pneumonia, providing a valuable tool for radiologists and other healthcare providers.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Pneumonia AI Dev project, please follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Navigate to the project directory:
3. Create a virtual environment:
4. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On Unix or MacOS:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
5. Install the required dependencies:

## Usage

To use the AI system, follow these steps:

1. Place your chest X-ray images in the `input_images` directory.
2. Run the detection script:
3. The results will be output in the `results` directory.
