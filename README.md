# Pneumonia Detection AI

This project uses a deep learning model built with the TensorFlow framework to detect pneumonia in X-ray images. The model architecture is based on the EfficientNetB7 model, which has achieved an accuracy of approximately 97% (96.96%) on our test data. This high accuracy rate is one of the strengths of our AI model.

## Model

The model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on a dataset of 8888 X-ray images. The dataset is a combination of the [chest-xray-pneumonia](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) dataset from Kaggle and the [Covid19-Pneumonia-Normal Chest X-Ray Images](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/dvntn9yhd2/1) from Mendeley.

## Usage

The project includes a Command Line Interface (CLI) for easy use of the model. The CLI, which is based on the [Python CLI template](https://github.com/Aydinhamedi/Python-CLI-template) from the same author, provides a user-friendly, colorful interface that allows you to interact with the model. You can run the CLI with the following command:

```
Interface\CLI\CLI.cmd
```

## Repository Structure

Please note that due to the large size of some files and folders, they are not available directly in the repository. However, they can be found in the [Releases](https://github.com/Aydinhamedi/Pneumonia-Detection-Ai/releases) page of the repository. This includes the model weights and the database, which are crucial for the functioning of the AI model.
